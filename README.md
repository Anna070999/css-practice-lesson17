## ✨ Purpose of the Project

This collection shows my ability to:

- Build clean and structured HTML  
- Work with CSS layouts  
- Use flexbox confidently  
- Apply animations & transitions  
- Create navigation and table layouts  
- Use BEM in real markup  
- Organize files professionally (`assets/css`, `assets/img`)

This is part of my ongoing learning as a Front-End Developer.
